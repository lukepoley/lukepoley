# 💫About Me :
The Problem: Financial teams often spend dozens of hours manually searching through thousands of JIB lines to identify audit-eligible transactions and locate their corresponding physical or digital invoices.

The Solution: I developed this tool to bridge the gap between raw financial data and audit-ready documentation. By integrating SQL-based data transformation directly into a Python workflow, the script:

Ensures Accuracy: Eliminates human error in filtering and sequence numbering.

Increases Efficiency: Redundant data is automatically flagged (using LAG logic), ensuring auditors only focus on unique entries.

Enhances Accessibility: By programmatically building file paths and hyperlinks, the "time-to-retrieval" for any given invoice is reduced from minutes to seconds.

"This project demonstrates my ability to apply software engineering patterns to solve real-world accounting and data-entry bottlenecks."
